	- Two main types of numbers:
		Integer : 4, -10
		Floating Point : 6.1, 0.0, 1.3333


####### Variables and Strings

		x = 100
		khaleesi_mother_of_dragons = 1
		print(khaleesi_mother_of_dragons + x)
		101

		all, at, once = 5, 10, 15


		1. Most variables should be snake_case (underscores between words)

		2. Most variables should be also be lowercase, with some exceptions:
			- CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (e.g. PI = 3.14)
			- UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class (more on that later)

		3. Variables that start and end with two underscores (called "dunder" for double underscore) are supposed to be private or left alone.

		>>> is_active = True
		>>> is_active
		True
		>>> game_over = False
		>>> game_over
		False
		>>> game_over = true
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
		NameError: name 'true' is not defined


- Python is highly flexible about reassigning variables to different types:
	awesomeness = True
	print(awesomeness) # True
	awesomeness = "a dog"
	print(awesomeness) # a dog
	awesomeness = None
	print(awesomeness) # None, means NULL in python

Special Value "None", means NULL

		>>> None
		>>> none
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
		NameError: name 'none' is not defined


		- String literals in Python can be declared with either single or double quotes.
			my_other_str = 'a hat'
			my_str = "a cat"
		- Either one is perfectly fine; but make sure you stick to the same convention throughout the same file.

		new_line = "hello \n world"
		print(new_line)
		# hello
		# world

		str_one = "your"
		str_two = "face"
		str_three = str_one + " " + str_two  # your face

		>>> username = "bluethecat"
		>>> print("Hello there and welcome to the game, : " + username)
		Hello there and welcome to the game, : bluethecat

        >>> 8 + "hello"
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

    ####### 10: Formatting Strings

    	x = 10
    	formatted = f"I've told you {x} times already!"

    	x = 10
		formatted = "I've told you {} times already!".format(x)

        >>> number = 10
        >>> print("Your number is" + number + "which is int")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: must be str, not int
        >>>
        >>> print(f"Your number is {number} which is int")
        Your number is 10 which is int

    --- String Interpolation

    >>> fruit = "banana"
    >>> ripeness = "unripe"
    >>> print("The {} is {}".format(fruit,ripeness))
    The banana is unripe

    - for 3.6+ this works,
    >>> print(f"The {fruit} is {ripeness}")
    The banana is unripe

    --- String Indexes

    >>> "lol"[0]
    'l'
    >>> name = "Chuck"
    >>> name[0]
    'C'
    >>> answer = "yessir"
    >>> answer[0]
    'y'
    >>> answer[-1]
    'r'

    --- Converting Data Types

    >>> decimal = 12.563457
    >>> integer = int(decimal)
    >>> integer
    12

    >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> my_list_as_a_string = str(my_list)
    >>> my_list_as_a_string
    '[1, 2, 3]'
    >>> print(my_list_as_a_string)
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> float(12)
    12.0
    >>> int(99.65)
    99
    >>> str(8)
    '8'

    $ cat mileage.py
    print("How many kilometers did you cycle today?")
    kms = input()
    miles = float(kms)/1.60934
    miles = round(miles, 2)
    print(f"Your {kms}km ride was {miles}mi ")
